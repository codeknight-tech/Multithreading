# C++ Multithreading Problem Solutions

This repository contains C++ solutions to problems and Learnings on my own focused on multithreading and concurrency, using the C++ Standard Library.Each file is a standalone implementation of a specific problem or pattern, written to reinforce core multithreading concepts.

## 🧩 Problem Topics (So Far)

- Thread creation and execution

> More problems and topics will be added as I continue learning and practicing.

## 🛠️ How to Build and Run

Compile with g++ or clang++ using the `-pthread` flag:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread problem_name.cpp -o problem
./problem
